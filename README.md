# io_scene_numdlb

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate model importer for Blender. May work for other games using the same format. Unlike the original script, this plugin is cross-platform, as it will work on any operating system that Blender and Python exist for. Animation file (.nuanmb) support will arrive later.
**This script is a work-in-progress; it's not yet ready for daily use!**
